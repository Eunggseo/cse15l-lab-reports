# Lab Report 4

* ### A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed in week 7
  [my repository](https://github.com/Eunggseo/markdown-parsenew/tree/main/markdown-parserWenyu)

  [reviewed one]( https://github.com/HantianLin/markdown-parser)

* ### For each test above:
1.  Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site

   VS code preview

2.  Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test

3. For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

4. For the implementation you reviewed in Week 7, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

* ### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for **snippet 1** and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

* ### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for **snippet 2** and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

* ### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for **snippet 3** and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

* ### If your code already works on some/all test cases, include an explanation of what were the code changes that allowed the tests to pass.

* ### Give an extra argument to git clone that specifies which directory to clone into, for example:

`$ git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-sp22/markdown-parse markdown-parse-target-directory`
